# Hi, I'm David! :D

I love reverse engineering and making things work where they're *not supposed to*. That means emulators, creating custom server implementations for games I like, and generally hacking around with systems to understand how they tick.  
(Just because I like these things doesn’t mean I’m great at them — but that’s part of the fun! :D )

## I’m currently studying
I just started my **Master’s in Computer Science** at [RWU](https://www.rwu.de/), where I’m focusing on **Robotics and Artificial Intelligence**.  

## I recently finished my Bachelor's Thesis
**Topic:** *Open Source Modules for Device Management*  
You can read about my work and findings in this blog post on the [doubleSlash blog](https://blog.doubleslash.de/en/iot-and-connected-things/successful-iot-device-management-how-to-scale-open-source-tools/)!  

My project involved evaluating open-source modules for IoT device management and building a proof of concept (PoC) system to test scalability and usability.

## I'm currently learning
- **Robotics & AI** – Perception, planning, and control for autonomous systems  
- **TypeScript** – For modern web and UI development  
- **Rust** – Exploring performance and safety in systems programming

## My Setup
- **OS**: Arch Linux (because why not?)  
- **Editor**: Neovim with [NvChad](https://github.com/Skydeke/nvim-config) — because I love customizing *everything*  
- **Dotfiles**: Check out my [Arch Linux configs](https://github.com/Skydeke/.dotfiles) if you’re into that sort of thing  
- Still looking for a good RSS reader :D
